Unibask — portal of collective intelligence — is a web application, which allows students to ask and answer questions. The quality of both questions and answers is decided
by users, who can rate them positively or negatively. The reputation of a user in the
user’s leader board is calculated from a rating of his entries. Questions are sorted by
categories. Users can follow a category, which allows them to have quick access to questions that are of his interest. Users can decide to turn on notifications for when a
new question is created in some category or for when a new entry is created in some
question. They can also opt-in for the option of having notifications delivered to them
through email. Application is using modern technologies, intuitive design and is optimized for all screen sizes. Portal was deployed in a course ’Programming (4)’ of the
Department of Applied Informatics during the summer semester of the school year
2021/2022.
